# Retroarch-Settings-Apps

Tired of uninstalling/reinstalling Retroarch every time you messed up with a setting or an override?  
Just add the zip files of the apps you want to use in hakchi2 and sync, they will appear as games on your console.  
If you want to make a separate folder for the apps, you can put `0retroarch-settings_icon.png` in `\hakchi2\folder_images` to add the icon in Folder Manager.

## /!\ For retroarch-clover users /!\

Default settings are slightly different than the ones from KMFDManic core set, so download `Retroarch-Clover_DefaultSettings.zip` and extract the 2 .cfg files in `\hakchi2\games_snes\CLV-P-ALLRA` and/or `CLV-P-RASET` (`\hakchi2\games` on NESC) before syncing.
